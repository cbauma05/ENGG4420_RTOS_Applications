# RTOS Implementation Through ENGG4420 Real Time System Design Laboratories

This repository details the implementation of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) projects as part of the ENGG4420 course. The following laboratories were completed:

## Lab 2: Real-Time System Implementation of a Producer-Consumer Communication System using FreeRTOS

This lab focused on implementing a producer-consumer communication system using the **FreeRTOS** kernel. Key objectives included understanding task synchronization, message queues, and mutual exclusion in a real-time environment.

## Lab 3: Real-Time Embedded Controller of a Hot Air Plant using uC-OS III with an STM32F4 and Integrated LCD

This project involved designing a real-time embedded controller for a hot air plant. The implementation utilized the **uC-OS III** RTOS on an **STM32F4** microcontroller, incorporating an integrated LCD for user interface and system monitoring.
